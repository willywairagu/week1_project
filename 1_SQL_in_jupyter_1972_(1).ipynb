        "There are generally two common architectures for interacting with SQL databases:\n",
        "- Client-server SQL - database systems that require separate server processes to function. In such cases, the user sets up a connection (typically with user credentials) to the server to interact with a database within it. The server can be located locally on the user's computer or remotely (i.e. on a cloud computer). Examples of  RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) that work this way include Microsoft SQL server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Serverless SQL - these systems allow the user to interact directly with the target SQL database, i.e., the SQL database is a file that gets loaded onto the application and can be read or written to using SQL queries. The specific flavour of serverless SQL we will use in this course is SQLite - a portable, serverless, and self-contained version of SQL. Instead of needing to connect to a SQL server for database access, SQLite loads a database from a single `.db` file, this file can be treated in a fashion similar to that of any other data file (e.g. a CSV) with the exception that we read and write to the file using SQL queries."
